Today, technology is everywhere. We have smartphones, laptops, and tablets around us all the time. This can make it hard to stay focused.

When I study, my phone is often a big problem. Messages and social media distract me very fast. To stay focused, I put my phone away or turn on silent mode.

I also try to use technology in a good way. For example, I use my laptop for research or online learning. Short breaks help me to stay concentrated.

In my opinion, technology is helpful, but only if we use it correctly. If we control technology, it can help us stay focused instead of distracting us.
